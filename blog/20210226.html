Hello!

I don't really know what I'm doing... I have never written
a blog post before.

Well, I guess I should talk about something relevant here...
Okay, I got it! This website.


Why did I make a website?

Why not? There's no real reason not to have a website
these days. I can have all my things in one place! How
awesome is that? And because I don't use any social media
platforms, I can have this one place where all my stuff
can be found at.


Why don't you just use one of the many already existing
blogging platforms?

I don't want to depend on another platform. Okay yeah this
website is currently dependent on github.io but that will
probably change in the future. Also, I don't trust those
platforms, like I don't trust any social media platforms.
It's just personal preference.


Huh, I guess that's everything I'm able to come up with
right now. I really need sleep because it's 1AM already,
again, haha.
