Game engine/framework hopping
Tue, 16 Mar 2021
____________________________________________________________

Hello again!

In this post, I would like to talk about game engines and
frameworks, or well, more just share my opinions on them.

Oh yeah and there are also libraries, but I
won't talk about them other than I'll mention a couple
libraries such as raylib at the end.


So, game engines vs. frameworks, what's the difference?

Explained well all over the internet, but a quick
explanation would go something like this:
(I am not a professional, this explanation is not very good)

A framework is just a collection of libraries and/or tools
that you use to make the game from almost the ground up.
Usually at a minimum, a framework gives you the tools to
show stuff on the screen and get user input.
E.g., SFML and libGDX

A game engine on the other hand, gives you loads of things,
like a full editor/UI, a world editor and a ton of other
things that I am not going to list.
E.g., Unity and Godot


Okay so, which do I prefer?

Well, both have their pros and cons, but I'll have to say
that I'm with Team Frameworks. Here's a couple things that
drove me to frameworks:
 * The size. For example, Unity is something like 20GB
   when installed, and that's quite a lot. Frameworks
   are usually quite small, like SDL2, which is only
   about ~7MB at the largest.

 * The lack of UI. I don't really need it, I know some
   people like it and that's completely fine, but it's
   just not for me.

 * Language support. Many game engines use scripting
   languages and other higher level languages such as
   Python, GDScript, C#, JavaScript and other. That becomes
   a problem when your favourite language is C++. Yes,
   there is some support for C++ in game engines (other
   than Unreal), but not the kind of support where I can
   only stick to C++.

 * I like optimizing stuff, and that's where the
   lower-level access and languages come in. With full
   game engines, you're quite limited on how much you
   can optimize, because most of the large engines are
   closed source for personal use.


What engines, frameworks and libraries have I tried so far?
In no particular order, here's a small list:
 * SFML
 * SDL2
 * raylib
 * Godot
 * Unity
 * Unreal
 * Flax
 * nCine
 * Dome
 * Orx
 * And others, I can't remember the names

I know that the above list isn't that long, but that's
because I have a couple requirements for new things that
I try:
 * Preferably open-source and under a reasonable license
 * 2D support
 * Good C++ support


So many options, you'd think I would have settled on one
already, right?

Right, I haven't. I don't know why. None of them seem
to meet my needs. I might have to take a couple months
off from thinking about game development and think of
another project until I want to revisit game dev.
